## Description

PennyWise is a budget app. From the beginning, in the planning stage, we decided to build an app that the first-time budgeter could use and enjoy. We believe that people are primarily concerned with monthly income and expenses, which is why our app is focused on a monthly financial outlook. The world is full of budget apps that are overly complicated, which leads to people who try them and then delete them. 

As a result, our app is rather simple. When you sign up, you are led through a set up process where you enter your income, recurring expenses, and savings. From there, there is a simple dashboard which shows the amount you can spend this month. You can update expenses and income throughout the month... the $ available is updated in realtime.
